### Discovery Process 1
Visualize environmental awareness across the globe.

After filtering for one variable, _Past two years: participated in demostration for environment_, the data is shown in tables for each country. The answeres are coded as categories. The percentage of people answering is shown.

Option to select the year the survey was taken. Data is not available for all countries. Only a few countries remain in the tables.

Only a graph per year, whereas the data is not available for each county. The percentages for each answer are visualized in a bar chart. No longitudinal data chart which shows the changes over the years.

Another option provided by the WVS visualization tool. The percentages for each country for one specific year is added, which results in the rather remarkable axes distribution.

This could be an interesting visualization of the data, but again the data is only shown for one year only. Data set is divided per wave and country. Weird structuring of data. The fact that there are large differences between waves doesnâ€™t make this easier.
